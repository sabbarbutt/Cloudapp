      <h2>How to Install</h2>
      <h3>Open the downloaded <i>Cloud Player.dmg</i> file</h3>
      <div class="img-holder">
        <img src="assets/desktop-app/osx-dmg.png" width="400px"/>
      </div>
      <p>After the Download has finished open the dmg file. Drag and drop the Cloud Player app into the <i>Applications</i> folder</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Start Cloud Player</h3>
      <p>
        As this is a student project we don't have an Apple developer certificate. Therefore we could not sign the application.
        When you try to start it, macOS will tell you that the application is from an unidentified developer.
        <br>
        <br>
        To open the app anyway locate Cloud Player in the <i>Applications</i> folder. Control click the Cloud Player app icon
        and then choose <i>Open</i> from the shortcut menu.
        <br>
        <br>
        This has to be done only when you start Cloud Player for the first time.

        As this is a student project we don't have an Windows developer certificate. Therefore we could not sign the application.
        The Windows Security Agent will prevent starting the installation process
        <br>
        <br>
        To start the installation anyway click on the button "More Info" (1). A new button "Run anyway" will appear (2).
        Click
        on that button to start the installation process
